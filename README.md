# UFOs
## Overview
Create a webpage showing the UFO sightings data with a dynamic table, which searchers can use it to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
### To perform a search
In the Filter Search part, enter the criteria for the search, example showing as below - 1/1/2012 for date and ca for state. Then, the table will show up the filterded sightings as the filters applied.

## Summary
### Drawback of this webpage
Every time the table filtered certain criteria, for instance, state, you will have to go back to the original table by clickicking the homepage link at the upper left corner ![Screen Shot 2021-09-05 at 3 51 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66225050/132143497-e8f9acf1-89eb-47c7-982a-b5dad559eee4.png). Or, clear out your entries.

### Additional recommendations for further development
1. Change the search event method to refresh the whole search when any criteria change so that users don't need to reload the page every time.
2. Now the search can only operate when the input filter match exact to the table content, which is a bit demanding to the users because they don't know the content at the very first place. We could probably add a dropdown options list for them to select instead of request input.
